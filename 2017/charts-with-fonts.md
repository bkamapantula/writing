# Charts with Fonts

*Originally posted on 22 November 2017, at: https://blog.gramener.com/using-fonts-to-draw-charts/*

Data visualization as a domain has traditionally been accessible predominantly to people with programming background. This involves designing a visualization, implementing the solution using a programming language with supporting libraries, if necessary. Visualization libraries — which require little programming experience — created in the past few years which are gaining momentum include RawGraphs, DataWrapper, Tableau (to an extent) ([extensive list](https://visualisingadvocacy.org/resources/visualisationtools)). Text narration in charts (created by the data viz community or news organizations) are not as legible as they could be.

## Bringing designers to the table

Given this, few font styles have emerged to visualize data. Designers and typographers can create new font-styles, which are already well supported in the web development, not for language alphabet but for data.

### How-to

Here, we generate basic charts using [AtF-Spark](http://aftertheflood.co/projects/atf-spark) font. Currently, the AtF-Spark font requires values to be within 0 to 100 or 0 to 9 depending on the chart type. Hence, raw values are scaled between 1 and 100 (for bar-medium), and are hence representative. A small set of charts are supported currently: bar chart (thin, narrow, medium styles), dot chart (small, medium styles), dot line chart (medium).

### Input

{21,0,75,85,100}

### Output

Advantages, Limitations

- easy to create, no programming required
- copy the underlying values in a chart
- charts are representative of data since they are scaled between 1 to 100 or 1 to 10 (depending on chart type).
- charts are not interactive

Recently, we have seen multiple reactive documents [Idyll, Tangle] techniques which will be instrumental for scientific, journalistic reporting apart from automatic narration for visualizations. With font-style charts, data visualization community needs more of these approaches with participation from diverse domain backgrounds. Among other things, this will be a game changer for narrative style communication for data-based products.
