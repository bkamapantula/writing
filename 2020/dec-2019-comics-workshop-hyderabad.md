## Background
To promote data storytelling within and outside the organization we started monthly data storytelling events first in Feb 2019 but became a regular practice from May to October (every second Friday of the month). Upon requests for a weekend event from the community we organized this workshop.

The focus of all our events is learning and not competition. Hence, we don't award participants for their work but encourage discussion with everyone around.

## Workshop
The workshop was carefully structured as follows:

| Session Title | What | By |
| ----- | ---- | -- |
| How to derive insights | What is an insight, how to find it | Bhasker Reddy |
| Insights through comics | Narrating insights using comics | Richie Lionell |
| Making comics | How to create characters, emotions, expressions, storyboarding | Ramya Mylavarapu |
| Comics on steroids | Interactive comics with Augmented Reality | Richie Lionell |
| Cant' draw? No problem! | Using [ComicGen](https://gramener.com/comicgen/) to create comics | Sunil Sharma |

The sessions are geared towards people who are interested to narrate stories through comic form.

## Logistics
### Registrations
For a capacity of 75 slots we were overbooked at 110. We did this assuming a higher dropout rate (30%) for free events.

To ensure participants turned up we telephoned the registrants, emailed/SMSed those whom we couldn't reach out to.

### Participants
The mix of participants was just right. We had people with different backgrounds: business, data analysts, students, data enthusiasts.

### Venue
ISB turned out to be perfect host for the event. The lecture hall had a great setup for multiple boards, audio-video, microphones, . It was more than what we requested for. Giri (from ISB) took great care of the setup and us.

## Volunteers
Organizing an external event is never easy and wouldn't be possible without all the volunteers who helped coordinate for logistics, food, printers, stickers, venue.
