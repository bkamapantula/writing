# Gifts

My recent experiences in organizing data comics workshops and curating a physical data visualization and interacting with audience renewed my data spirits.

Public communication is a powerful medium to take data visualization, data insights to common people (so-called non-technical folk). While conferences, workshops are a way to engage with public it isn't the only way.

Gramener's business cards are a good way to introduce data visualizations for an engaging conversation.

I like gifting people. It's something I haven't done in long time as a choice.

After procrastinating the last two years, I'll be creating data gift cards this time. Each card will have a mix of data insight(s), chart(s), interactive marker.

- Data insights and charts will be based on data portals I've contributed to, others like [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/).
- I don't know how interactive markers might look like. Having tried Kate Compton's [tracery](tracery.io/) for procedural text generation, I'd like to try her [generominos](https://www.galaxykate.com/generominos/).

I'll share progress as I make them.
